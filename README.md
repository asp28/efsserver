## Running Server

To run the server run the EfsserverApplication file in an IDE. Current build can be exported to JAR but will not run some functionality due to filepath error.

A Live version is available at https://www.ankeetpatel.co.uk:8080/api/auth/test . This is to show that the SSL certificate is valid and working but should not be used as a working final version.
